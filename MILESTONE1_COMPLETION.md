# Milestone 1 Completion Report

## Accomplished

1. **Test Coverage Analysis**
   - Ran test coverage and identified areas with lower coverage
   - Total test coverage: 78.26% statements, 66.3% branches
   - Identified `ConversationList.tsx` as having the lowest coverage (66% statements)

2. **Improved Error Handling in Components**
   - Enhanced error handling in `ConversationList.tsx` for date formatting functions
   - Implemented better type safety and error handling in `DynamicForm.tsx`
   - Added proper null/undefined checks to improve robustness

3. **Package Organization**
   - Created shared model packages in `packages/models`
   - Created utils package in `packages/utils`
   - Started the migration to a more modular architecture

4. **Fixed API Routes**
   - Updated the conversation message routes to properly handle parameters
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Package Management Issues**
   - Workspace protocol (`workspace:*`) not supported by npm
   - Need to convert to using actual version numbers

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Need to properly configure TypeScript to resolve imports from packages
   - Multiple path configuration issues between workspaces

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Jest configuration needs updating to work with the new package structure
   - Need to install missing dependencies like `next/jest`

## Next Steps for Milestone 2

1. **Complete Migration to Package Structure**
   - Finish moving all shared models to the packages
   - Update all imports consistently across the codebase

2. **Fix Building and Testing**
   - Configure proper building of packages
   - Update Jest configuration for the new structure

3. **Improve Linting Rules**
   - Add more specific ESLint rules for React components
   - Configure linting for better type safety

4. **LLM Integration with Orchestrator**
   - Begin implementing more complex orchestrator logic
   - Add LLM integration points for enhanced functionality
