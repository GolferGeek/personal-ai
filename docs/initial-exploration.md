I want to write an application called Personal-AI. 

I want it to be a Next.js application. 

So imagine that the front end would be a screen where things can be shown and things can be entered. So, very simple, Next.js page. 

On there, of course, is a button push to talk. So when you talk, you are basically talking to an orchestrator agent. 

That orchestrator agent can do a growing number of things based on AI agents and AI tools. 

This is also going to be a demonstration application for people to understand what agents are and what they are seeing. is, and what orchestrators can do, and also be my own personal AI as it grows out. 

So I see it as having an API layer where all of my agents can be called from outside should they be needed by other applications. 
- Some of the API routes will actually be coded, for instance, with... say Lang chain or Lang graph or Open AI's agents dot SDK or crew AI or whatever although I'd like to stick with JavaScript if I can. 
- Some of them will just be API calls out to systems like in 8N or Azure Foundry AI. Those are the agents that's the building of the agents and the calling of the agents, say a RAG agent or 

But I also really wanna focus on how to build mcp servers so they would have their own API I am assuming I'm gonna have you actually explain how I can work this in but I assume that MCPs are really just api's with a very set protocol thus the name 

so I would have an API and an app slash MCP both of those I'm assuming would be sort of api-ish and you'd be called from outside so if other services or other apps could call my mcps the same way they could call my agents 

in fact i'm wondering if we should also wrap some of our agents as mcps 

this is all an exploratory thing so what i'd like for you to do is see if you can parse it and understand kind of what i'm thinking so we can go from there.
