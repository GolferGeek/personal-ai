# Milestone 2 Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Package Structure Migration**
   - Created shared models package (`@personal-ai/models`) with conversation and message models
   - Created utilities package (`@personal-ai/utils`) with formatters, validators, and API utilities
   - Created UI components package (`@personal-ai/ui`) with all necessary components:
     - ConversationList
     - DynamicForm
     - ConversationDisplay
     - TextInputButton
     - ErrorDisplay

2. **Next.js Web App Migration**
   - Set up basic app structure in the monorepo
   - Migrated all core app files (layout, providers, styles, pages)
   - Updated imports to use the shared packages
   - Migrated all API routes to the monorepo structure:
     - Conversation routes
     - Agent routes
     - Orchestration routes
   - Configured Next.js with proper monorepo settings

## In Progress

1. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Need to complete proper module resolution
   - Fix type errors in the migrated components and API routes

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Basic Jest setup is complete
   - Need to update component tests to use the new package structure
   - Need to set up proper test mocks and fixtures

3. **NestJS API App Development**
   - Basic structure is set up
   - Need to implement controllers and services for:
     - Conversations
     - Agents
     - Orchestration

## Challenges and Observations

1. **Module Resolution Issues**
   - TypeScript paths configuration needs adjustment for proper imports
   - Linting shows many "module not found" errors despite structure being correct

2. **Package Manager Compatibility**
   - Need to decide on a final package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
   - Current setup has some workspace protocol issues with npm

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Need to determine the best approach for testing in a monorepo
   - Component testing needs to be adjusted for the new package structure

## Next Steps

1. **Complete TypeScript Configuration**
   - Fix module resolution issues
   - Update tsconfig files to properly reference packages

2. **Improve Testing Setup**
   - Update tests to use the new package structure
   - Create test helpers for common test patterns

3. **Start NestJS Implementation**
   - Begin implementing the backend API with proper controllers and services
   - Set up database connections and repositories

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Set up proper build scripts for the monorepo
   - Configure watch mode for development
   - Set up CI/CD workflow

## Timeline

- Estimated time to complete remaining tasks: 5-7 days
- Focus areas for the next 2-3 days:
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Testing infrastructure
